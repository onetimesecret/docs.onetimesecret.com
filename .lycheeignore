# Lychee Link Checker Ignore Patterns
# Patterns in this file will be ignored by the link checker

# Exclude local/private URLs
http://localhost*
http://127.0.0.1*
http://0.0.0.0*

# Exclude URLs that require authentication
https://github.com/*/settings/*
https://github.com/*/new/*

# Exclude URLs that commonly rate limit or block bots
# (These can be manually checked periodically)
https://www.linkedin.com/*
https://twitter.com/*
https://x.com/*

# Exclude placeholder/example URLs
https://example.com/*
https://yourdomain.com/*
https://yourbrand.com/*
https://secrets.yourdomain.com
https://*.yourdomain.com
http://*.yourdomain.com

# Exclude URLs that might be in code examples but not real
mailto:*

# Exclude static asset paths (served from public/ at runtime, not in content dir)
.*/img/.*
.*/socialcards/.*

# Exclude missing translations/guide pages (only en and zh-cn have this file;
# other locale index pages link to it but the pages don't exist yet)
.*/translations/guide$

# Note: The internal link check uses --root-dir src/content/docs with
# --fallback-extensions md,mdoc so that root-relative content paths
# (like /en/regions/) resolve correctly in offline mode.
