# Lychee Link Checker Ignore Patterns
# Patterns in this file will be ignored by the link checker

# Exclude local/private URLs

# Exclude URLs that require authentication

# Exclude URLs that commonly rate limit or block bots
# (These can be manually checked periodically)
https://www.linkedin.com/*
https://twitter.com/*
https://x.com/*

# Exclude placeholder/example URLs
https://example.com/*
https://yourdomain.com/*
https://yourbrand.com/*

# Exclude URLs that might be in code examples but not real
mailto:*

# Exclude specific patterns that are known to be problematic
# Add site-specific exclusions below as needed

# Note: In offline mode, lychee will produce warnings for paths starting with /
# (like /en/introduction/ or /img/...) because it can't convert them to URIs.
# These warnings are expected and can be ignored - the paths work correctly in
# production when served by Astro. The important thing is that lychee exits with
# code 0 (no broken links), not that there are zero warnings.
