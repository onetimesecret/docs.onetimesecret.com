# Archived Configuration Content

This directory contains translated configuration documentation that was temporarily removed from the main documentation site.

## Background

The configuration section was added to the documentation site a few months ago, but the code has diverged significantly from the documentation, making these pages more confusing than helpful.

## Content

- `en/` - Original English configuration documentation
- `de/` - German translations
- `es/` - Spanish translations

## Purpose

These files are archived here for future reference when:
1. The configuration documentation needs to be updated to match current code
2. New translations are being prepared
3. The configuration section is ready to be re-enabled

## Re-enabling

To re-enable the configuration section:

1. Move the desired language directories back to `src/content/docs/{lang}/configuration/`
2. Uncomment the configuration section in `config/sidebar.mjs`
3. Update content to match current codebase
4. Test all translated versions
