## API Overview (updated 2024-11-06)

### Base URI `https://onetimesecret.com/api`
All API access is over HTTPS and starts with `/api`. All responses are JSON.

### Authentication
We support two modes of API usage:

#### Authenticated Access

`https://USERNAME:APITOKEN@onetimesecret.com/api`

- Use HTTP Basic Authentication for full API capabilities
- The username is your account login
- The password is the API token from your account page

#### Anonymous Access

`https://onetimesecret.com/api`

- Limited functionality available without authentication
- Ideal for quick, one-time secret sharing
- Can be used for both creating and retrieving secrets

### Data Locality
One Time Secret supports multiple geographic data centers. We follow a zero data sharing policy between regions, ensuring complete data isolation. Choose the right data center for your needs:

- **EU Data Center:** [eu.onetimesecret.com](https://eu.onetimesecret.com/)
- **US Data Center:** [us.onetimesecret.com](https://us.onetimesecret.com/)

#### Key Considerations:
- Requests to `onetimesecret.com` may be routed to any active data center
- The location of your secret is always clear from the generated link (e.g., `us.onetimesecret.com/secret/abcd1234`)
- You can choose a specific data locality by navigating directly to the desired domain
- **NOTE:** Currently, access via `onetimesecret.com/api` is still operational but using a specific locality is recommended as this functionality may be deprecated in the future.

### System Status

`GET https://onetimesecret.com/api/v1/status`
Current status of the system.
