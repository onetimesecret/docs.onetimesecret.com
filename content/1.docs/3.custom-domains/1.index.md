## What are Custom Domains?

Custom Domains allow you to use your own domain name for Onetime Secret links, instead of the default _onetimesecret.com_ domain. This feature incorporates your brand identity into the secret sharing experience, enhancing trust and professionalism.

## How Custom Domains Work

1. You register a domain or use one you already own.
2. Choose your preferred data center region (EU or US).
3. [Configure your domain's DNS settings](/docs/custom-domains/setup-guide) to point to Onetime Secret's servers in your chosen region.
4. Set up the custom domain in your Onetime Secret account settings.
5. Once verified, your secret links will use your custom domain.

## Getting Started

To set up a Custom Domain:

1. Log in to your Onetime Secret account.
2. Navigate to Account Settings > Custom Domains.
3. Enter the domain you wish to use and click "Add Domain".
4. Select your preferred data center region (EU or US).
5. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided for DNS configuration.
6. Wait for the domain to be verified. If available, click the "Verify" button to expedite the process. You may need to refresh the page.

For detailed instructions, including how to choose between EU and US regions, please refer to our [Custom Domain Setup Guide](/docs/custom-domains/setup-guide).

## Important Considerations

- Custom Domains are a premium feature available with the Identity plan.
- You are responsible for maintaining and renewing your domain registration.
- Proper SSL/TLS configuration is crucial for security (handled automatically by Onetime Secret).
- Ensure your chosen domain complies with your organization's branding guidelines.
- Consider data protection regulations when choosing between EU and US regions.

## Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

- **DNS Propagation**: Changes may take up to 48 hours to fully propagate. Be patient and try again later if verification fails initially.
- **Incorrect DNS Records**: Double-check your DNS settings against the provided instructions for your chosen region.
- **SSL Certificate Issues**: Contact our support team if you encounter any SSL-related problems.
- **Domain Ownership Verification**: Ensure you have full control over the domain you're trying to set up.
- **Region Selection**: If you're unsure about which region to choose, consult our [Data Center Regions](/docs/regions) guide or contact our support team.
