# Minimal Data Collection

We believe that the best way to protect user data is to not collect it in the first place.

## Our Data Minimization Strategy

- Collect only the data absolutely required for service functionality
- Automatically delete data as soon as it's no longer needed
- Provide clear opt-out and data deletion mechanisms

## Practical Implementation

By adhering to strict data minimization principles, we ensure that:
- We never store more information than absolutely necessary
- User data is ephemeral and transient by design
- Users have complete control over their data lifecycle
