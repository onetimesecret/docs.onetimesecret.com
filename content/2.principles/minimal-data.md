# Minimal Data: Less is More

In an era of data proliferation, we take a radical approach: collect only what is absolutely necessary. Our minimal data collection principle is a fundamental commitment to user privacy and digital minimalism.

## Why Minimal Data Matters

### 1. Reducing Risk
Every piece of data collected is a potential vulnerability. By minimizing data collection, we dramatically reduce the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.

### 2. Respecting User Privacy
We believe your data is yours. We don't collect, store, or process any information beyond what is essential to provide our secure secret-sharing service.

### 3. Transparent Data Practices
We document every data point we collect, why we collect it, and how long we retain it. No hidden data collection, no surprises.

## Our Data Minimization Strategy

### Absolute Necessity
- We only collect data directly required for the core functionality of our service
- Temporary data is immediately deleted after its purpose is served
- We never sell, rent, or monetize user data

### Ephemeral by Design
- Secrets are designed to be temporary
- Metadata is kept to an absolute minimum
- User interactions are not tracked beyond service requirements

### User Control
- Users have complete visibility into what data is collected
- Easy opt-out and data deletion mechanisms
- No tracking, no profiling, no compromise

## Continuous Improvement

We continuously review and reduce our data collection practices. Our goal is to provide a robust service while maintaining the highest standards of privacy.
