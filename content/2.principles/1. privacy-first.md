# Privacy First Practices

At Onetime Secret, we take a markedly different approach to user privacy. Here's what we deliberately choose not to do, and more importantly, why.

## Our No-Email Philosophy

Most services flood your inbox with marketing messages. We don't. The only emails you'll receive from us are the ones you specifically request: secret link deliveries. No newsletters, no updates, no promotions.

In our entire history, we've never sent a marketing email. Your inbox belongs to you.
::

## Industry Standards We Skip

We deliberately avoid common tracking and marketing tools:

::list{type="danger"}
- Analytics packages that track user behavior
- Social media integration buttons
- Advertising networks
- A/B testing frameworks
- Marketing automation tools
- Third-party tracking pixels
::

## Why This Matters

Our approach centers on three core principles:

::list{type="success"}
- Respect privacy: Your data is yours, period
- Focus on reliability: The tool should simply work when you need it
- Build trust through action: We prove our commitment through what we don't do
::

## The Real Impact

By avoiding standard marketing and tracking practices, we:

- Maintain a cleaner, faster service
- Reduce potential security vulnerabilities
- Keep your data under direct control
- Stay focused on our core purpose

We invest our time in:

## Looking Forward

We'll continue prioritizing simplicity and privacy over marketing reach. While this means we might grow more slowly than services that aggressively market themselves, we believe it's the right choice for a privacy-focused tool.
