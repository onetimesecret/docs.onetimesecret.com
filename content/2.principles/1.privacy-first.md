# Privacy First Practices

::principle-highlight{title="Our Approach"}
At Onetime Secret, we take a markedly different approach to user privacy. We deliberately choose not to do what most services do, focusing instead on our core purpose: secure secret sharing.

## Core Principles

::principle-highlight{title="Privacy By Design"}
Our approach centers on three foundational principles:

- Your data is yours, period
- The tool should simply work when you need it
- We prove our commitment through what we don't do

We believe focusing on these essentials creates a better service than chasing growth through marketing.

## Our Email Philosophy

::principle-highlight{title="Minimal Communication"}
In our entire history, we've never sent a marketing email. The only emails you'll receive from us are the ones you specifically request: secret link deliveries.

We respect your inbox as much as we respect your data.

## Looking Forward

::alert{type="success"}
You can trust Onetime Secret to be there when you need it, without the constant reminders that you have an account with us.
::

::principle-highlight{title="Our Commitment"}
We'll continue prioritizing privacy and simplicity over aggressive growth. While this means we might grow more slowly than services that aggressively market themselves, we believe it's the right choice for a privacy-focused tool.
