# Privacy by Design

Privacy is not an afterthought—it's a fundamental design consideration from the very beginning of our product development process.

## Key Aspects

- Privacy considerations are integrated into every stage of product design
- We proactively anticipate and prevent privacy risks
- Security is built into our architecture, not added as a layer on top
- We minimize data collection and retention by default

## Our Approach

At OneTime, "Privacy by Design" means we don't just comply with privacy regulations—we exceed them. Every feature, every line of code is written with user privacy as a primary concern.
