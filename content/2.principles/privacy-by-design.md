# Privacy by Design: A Fundamental Approach

At OneTime, Privacy by Design is not just a featureâ€”it's our foundational philosophy. We believe that privacy should be proactively embedded into the very architecture of our service, rather than added as an afterthought.

## Core Principles

### 1. Proactive Privacy Protection
We anticipate and prevent privacy risks before they emerge. Our systems are designed with privacy as a default setting, ensuring that user data is protected from the ground up.

### 2. Privacy as the Default
Our service automatically protects user privacy without requiring manual configuration. Users don't need to be privacy experts to stay secure.

### 3. Minimal Data Collection
We collect only the absolute minimum data necessary to provide our service. Every piece of data is carefully considered and justified.

### 4. Transparent Practices
We maintain complete transparency about our data handling practices. Users always know how their information is used and protected.

### 5. End-to-End Security
From encryption to data deletion, every step of our service is designed with privacy in mind. We implement state-of-the-art security measures to protect user data.

## Our Commitment

Privacy by Design means we view privacy not as a compliance checkbox, but as a core ethical responsibility. We continuously evolve our practices to stay ahead of emerging privacy challenges.
