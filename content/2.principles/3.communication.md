# Our Communication Philosophy

We take a deliberately minimal approach to user communication, respecting your time and inbox.

## Our No-Email Philosophy

Most services flood your inbox with:
- Marketing newsletters
- Product updates
- Usage statistics
- Feature announcements
- Promotional offers
- Re-engagement campaigns

In our entire history, we've never sent a marketing email. The only emails you'll receive from us are the ones you specifically request: secret link deliveries. No newsletters, no updates, no promotions. We believe your inbox belongs to you.

## Why This Matters

By avoiding standard marketing and communication practices, we:
- Maintain a cleaner, simpler service
- Reduce potential security risks
- Keep focused on our core purpose
- Respect your time and attention

## Our Focus Instead

We invest our time and resources in:
- Improving core functionality
- Strengthening privacy protections
- Ensuring reliable service
- Addressing jurisdictional compliance
- Maintaining transparent operations
