Secret Links are versatile and can be applied in many situations where secure, one-time sharing of information is crucial. Here are some common use cases:


### 1. Basic Password Sharing at work

When you need a quick, secure way to share a password or API key, secret links offer a simple solution. While password managers are the best choice for long-term credential management and team sharing, secret links provide a lightweight alternative that anyone can use without special software or accounts. The self-destructing nature of these links ensures that sensitive credentials aren't lingering in email inboxes or chat histories where they could be compromised.

**Benefit**: This approach provides a fast, no-setup way to share credentials securely when you need it. It eliminates risky practices like storing passwords in plaintext emails, while keeping the sharing process simple and friction-free for everyone involved.

### 2. Netflix and WiFi Passwords

When sharing streaming service credentials or home WiFi passwords with family members and houseguests, use secret links to securely transmit the information. Simply create the link and send it through your usual messaging apps. Once they've viewed the password, the link becomes inactive, keeping your accounts secure even if someone later gains access to the message history.

**Benefit**: This provides a convenient way to share access without compromising long-term security. Even if a phone is lost or messaging account is compromised months later, the sensitive information won't be exposed since it was never stored in the message history.

### 3. Payment Information

When you need to share payment details like credit card information or digital wallet addresses with service providers or trusted contacts, use secret links instead of typing sensitive information directly into messages or emails. Create a secure link containing your payment details, share it with the recipient, and once they've accessed the information, it's automatically removed â€“ ensuring your financial data doesn't remain exposed in communication threads.

**Benefit**: This method protects your financial security by ensuring sensitive payment information doesn't accumulate in email threads, chat histories, or text messages. It gives you peace of mind knowing that your account details won't be vulnerable if any of these communication channels are ever compromised.

### 4. Software License Keys
When distributing purchased software licenses to employees or clients, use secret links to share the activation keys. This ensures that valuable license keys can't be accidentally reused or shared beyond their intended recipient, and helps prevent the keys from being archived in email systems where they might be vulnerable to unauthorized access.

**Benefit**: This method maintains control over software asset distribution while making it easy for recipients to access their license keys when needed for installation or reactivation.

### 5. Two-Factor Recovery Codes
When setting up 2FA on important accounts, securely store your backup/recovery codes using a secret link. If you need to access these codes later due to a lost device, you can be confident they haven't been sitting exposed in your email or notes. Create a new secret link once you've used the codes to maintain security.

**Benefit**: Provides a more secure alternative to storing recovery codes in plaintext while ensuring they remain accessible when truly needed for account recovery.

### 6. Interview Assignments
When sending coding challenges or technical assessments to job candidates, use secret links to share the requirements. This ensures each candidate gets a fresh copy of the assignment and can't access it again after viewing, helping maintain the integrity of your hiring process.

**Benefit**: Simplifies assignment distribution while helping ensure candidates complete their assessments independently and can't share the exact requirements with others.


## Summary

These use cases demonstrate the flexibility and security benefits of Secret Links across various industries and scenarios. By leveraging Secret Links, organizations and individuals can significantly enhance their information security practices and reduce the risks associated with sharing sensitive data.

## Note About Anonymous Tips

Secret Links can be suitable for basic anonymous tips with some important caveats:

### Advantages of Onetime Secret for Anonymous Tips
- No account required
- Accessible via Tor network
- Content is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Limited log retention period (about 2 weeks)
- Cannot be retrieved once viewed

### Limitations
- Consider organizational/legal requirements
- No built-in anonymous communication channel
- Basic metadata may be logged temporarily
- Network-level anonymity depends on user OPSEC

## Whistleblowers and Personal Risk Scenarios

For whistleblowing involving sensitive organizational or legal matters, dedicated whistleblowing platforms with additional protections are strongly recommended. When handling sensitive disclosures:

- Use dedicated whistleblowing platforms that provide comprehensive security protections and anonymity features
- Be aware that IP addresses and access times may be logged by various systems
- Consider consulting trusted organizations like the Freedom of the Press Foundation (freedom.press) or the Electronic Frontier Foundation (eff.org) for detailed guidance on secure whistleblowing practices and tools
