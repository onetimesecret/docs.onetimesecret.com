# We Only Collect What's Needed

**Description:** At Onetime Secret, we collect only the data required to deliver our service: temporary secrets and the minimum account information needed for paid subscriptions. This keeps things simple and secure.

**Why This Matters:**

1. **Less Risk:** The less data we store, the less there is to protect. By collecting only what's necessary, we reduce potential security risks.

2. **Clear Purpose:** Every piece of information we collect has a specific purpose in delivering our service. No tracking, no analytics, no extras.

3. **Zero-Knowledge Design**: We can't access your secrets and don't want to. Each secret is encrypted, accessible only once, and automatically deleted after viewing or expiration.

**How It Works:**

1. **For Single Secrets:** We only store the encrypted secret until it's viewed or expires. After that, it's permanently deleted. (Other than the minimal encrypted backups we keep in case of emergency. We discuss this more in our [Privacy Policy](https://onetimesecret.com/info/privacy).)

2. **For Registered Users:** We keep just enough information to manage your account and provide the service you've paid for. That's why we only collect an email address. We don't collect name or profile details because you don't need those features.

3. **No Tracking:** We don't use cookies for tracking, analytics, or advertising. The only cookie we use is for keeping you logged in if you choose to create an account.

This approach has served us and our users well since 2012. It's simple, effective, and respects your privacy.
