## Language preferences

*Guidance: This involves determining language-specific preferences, such as spelling variations, punctuation rules, and date and time formats, which resonate with your target audience. — Remember, adhering closely to your audience's language preferences can significantly reduce barriers to communication and enhance their experience with the brand.*

- Use American English. However for date formats use yyyy-mm-dd and times use 24h. Distances in km, weights in lbs.
- Translations should sound as natural as possible. Borrowed words should never be used (with the exception of branded names).
- Our english speaking audience is 50% english as a first language and 50% as a second/third/professional language. We need to keep this in mind when choosing terms and phrases to avoid inappropriate or confusing translations.

## Grammar and style guidelines

*Guidance: Pinpoint rules for grammar, style, and punctuation to maintain consistency throughout all your translated content.*

- Use oxford commas, periods, and question marks. Avoid exclamations, contractions, and semi-colons.
- Use active, imperative voice where users take action. Use passive or declarative voice when informing users.
- Sentence fragments are ok on their own. Otherwise full sentences with proper business grammar.
- Divide lengthy information into multiple sentences, if needed.
- In general, use the second person (`you`) to address the user.
- Avoid using the first person (`my`, `I`) as it can create confusion about who is being addressed.

## Terminology consistency

*Create a glossary of key terms, along with their approved translations, to ensure consistent usage across all content.*

### Brand Terms (Do Not Translate)

- Onetime Secret
- OTS (when used as product abbreviation)
- Identity Plus (product name)
- Global Elite (product name)
- Custom Install (product name)

### About the Brand Name

In "Onetime Secret", "Onetime" functions as a compound adjective (also called a attributive adjective) that modifies the noun "Secret". It describes a key characteristic of the secret - that it can only be accessed once. Note the spelling choice. There are actually three common variants of this term:

- "one-time" (hyphenated)
- "one time" (two words)
- "onetime" (compound)

The hyphenated form "one-time" is considered the standard spelling when the term functions as an adjective before a noun, as in "one-time password" or "one-time code". This follows the general English rule that compound modifiers before nouns are often hyphenated.

The compound form is the canonical spelling for the brand and company name: Onetime Secret.

### Core Concepts

#### Secret Management

- **secret** (n.) - The confidential information being shared
    - Translations must maintain the context of confidentiality
    - Preferred over terms like "message" or "content"
    - Example: "Create a new secret" not "Create a new message"
- **one-time** (adj.) - Describing the single-use nature of the service
    - Must emphasize the temporary, single-use aspect
    - Hyphenated when used as adjective
    - Example: "This is a one-time secret" not "This is a single secret"
- **Onetime** (compound adj.) - Part of the brand name Onetime Secret.
    - Must not be used on its own; always paired with "Secret"
    - Example: "Onetime Secret"
- **burn** (v.) - The act of destroying a secret before it's viewed
    - Technical term for destruction of a secret message
    - Translations should maintain the permanence implied
    - Example: "The secret was burned and no longer available"

#### Security Terms

- **encryption** (n.) - The process of encoding secrets
    - Technical term that should remain consistent
    - Distinguish from "encoding" or "hashing"
    - Example: "All secrets use end-to-end encryption"
- **rate limiting** (n.) - System to prevent abuse
    - Technical term for request restriction
    - Keep hyphenation in English
    - Example: "Rate limiting prevents abuse"
- **secure**
- **private**
- **password / passphrase**
- **expiration / expiry / time-to-live**

### Translating Key Terms

#### Translating the word "secret"

The word "secret" is central to our brand, product, and communication strategy. We protect secrets. We also provide a secret service.

The word secret can take a number of meanings with subtle but important differences. Our canonical example comes from an update to our Danish translation by [jetdk](https://github.com/onetimesecret/onetimesecret/pull/956#issue-2782747525):

##### Word Choice: "Beskeder" vs "Hemmeligheder"

CORRECT:   **Beskeder** (messages)
INCORRECT: Hemmeligheder (secrets)

The term "Beskeder" should be used when referring to a secret (e.g. a secret message or secret link that is generated by Onetime Secret). While "Hemmeligheder" is a literal translation of "Secrets", it carries connotations of personal or hidden information in everyday Danish usage that don't match the intended meaning.

Example usage:

✅ Du har 3 nye beskeder (You have 3 new messages)
❌ Du har 3 nye hemmeligheder (You have 3 new secrets)

### Translating "password" vs "passphrase"

Onetime Secret makes an important distinction between two security concepts that must be consistently maintained across all translations:

#### Password
- **Definition**: A standard authentication credential used for account access
- **Context**: Used exclusively for logging into user accounts on the Onetime Secret platform
- **Examples**: "Account password", "Login password", "Reset password"
- **Translation guidance**:
  - Use the most common, standard term in your language for authentication credentials
  - This should be the term users would expect to see when logging into any website
  - Typically shorter and more familiar to general users

#### Passphrase
- **Definition**: A security measure specifically for protecting individual secrets
- **Context**: Used when creating or accessing protected secrets (not for account access)
- **Examples**: "Protect with passphrase", "Enter passphrase to view", "Passphrase-protected secret"
- **Translation guidance**:
  - Must be clearly distinguished from regular account passwords
  - Should convey the concept of a potentially longer, phrase-based protection mechanism
  - If your language lacks a direct equivalent, create a consistent compound term that conveys this specialized security concept
  - Consider terms equivalent to "key phrase", "access phrase", or "security phrase" if needed

#### Maintaining the Distinction

Different languages handle this distinction in various ways:

| Language | Password (Account) | Passphrase (Secret Protection) | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------------|-------|
| English  | password          | passphrase                   | Clear distinction with compound word |
| Bulgarian| парола (parola)   | ключова фраза (klyuchova fraza) | "Key phrase" |
| Danish   | adgangskode       | adgangssætning               | "Access code" vs "Access sentence" |
| Spanish  | contraseña        | frase de seguridad           | "Counter-sign" vs "Security phrase" |

When translating these terms:

1. Always maintain consistent distinction between the two concepts
2. Test your chosen terms with native speakers unfamiliar with the product
3. Ensure the passphrase term conveys additional security/complexity compared to password
4. Use the exact same term for each concept throughout the entire translation

✅ Correct approach:
Account section: "Enter your [PASSWORD] to log in"
Secret section: "This secret is protected with a [PASSPHRASE]"

❌ Incorrect approach:
Using the same term for both concepts, or inconsistently switching between terms

#### User Management

- **colonel** (n.) - Administrator role
    - Project-specific term, rhymes with "kernel" which is a technical term and central component of an operating system. No other project uses this term in this way. It can be confusing even in North America.
    - Translate to the common term for an "administrator" in the context of software permissions. The account with the highest level of privileges.
    - Example: "Only colonels can access this feature" (i.e. "Only admins can access this feature").
- **plan** (n.) - Subscription level
    - Use consistently for service tiers
    - Prefer over "tier" or "level"
    - Example: "Upgrade to a premium plan"

## Formatting and layout

*Set standards for formatting, layout, and typography to maintain visual and design consistency across different languages.*

- Use consistent header styles to improve readability and content flow. For example H1 for main headings, H2, H3, etc for sub-headings
- Write headings in sentence case unless the heading is a punctuated sentence:
    - Good example: How localization drives growth for fintech firms
    - Good example: Localization made easy. Why wait?
    - Bad example: How Localization Drives Growth for Fintech Firms
    - Bad example: Localization made easy. why wait?

### Time format

Generally, a 12-hour clock is used in the United States. 24-hour clocks are used in aviation and other logistical contexts.

### Numerals

|  Symbol Purpose  |  Character Name  |  Symbol  |  Example  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Decimal  |  Period  |  `.`  |  1.23  |
|  Thousands  |  Comma  |  `,`  |  1,234  |
|  Percentage  |  Percent sign  |  `%`  |  99.95%  |

### Currency

The currency of the Canada is the Canadian Dollar (CAD). The monetary symbols are `$` and rarely `¢`.

### Units of measurement

The imperial system is used for everyday weights in Canada. Everything else including distances, quantities, are in metric. Primarily m, Km, cm, mm ("deci" is used rarely).

### Address and postal code format

    [addressee]
    [street number and name][building and suite numbers]
    [district][city][state/province][postal code]
    [Country]

    British Columbia Sugar Refinery Ltd.
	123 Rogers Street
    Vancouver, BC. V6A 3N2
    CANADA
