Onetime Secret documentation is available in multiple languages to serve our diverse global community. We're continuously working to expand our language offerings and improve existing translations.

## Available Languages

- **English (en)**: Our default and most complete version
- **German (de)**: Partial translation in progress

You can switch between languages using the language selector in the top-right corner of any page.

## Translation Status

## Contributing Translations

We welcome contributions to our translation efforts. If you'd like to help translate Onetime Secret documentation to your language, please follow these guidelines:

### Translation Workflow

1. **Locate content**: Original English content is stored in the `/content/docs/en/` directory
2. **Create corresponding files**: Create matching files in your language's directory (e.g., `/content/docs/de/`)
3. **Keep structure**: Maintain the same directory structure and file naming conventions
4. **Preserve frontmatter**: Copy all frontmatter fields, translating only the values
5. **Submit your work**: Use [GitHub Pull Requests](https://github.com/onetimesecret/onetimesecret) for submissions

### Translation Standards

For consistent, high-quality translations, follow our [Translation Style Guide](/en/translations/guide-en) and refer to our [Terminology Glossary](/en/translations/glossary) for standardized translations of key terms.

## Handling Missing Translations

When content is not available in a selected language, you'll automatically see the English version with a notification indicating the content hasn't been translated yet.
