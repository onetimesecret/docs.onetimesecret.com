# Universal Translation Guidance

This section contains translation guidance that applies across all languages. Review these resources before starting any translation work, as they establish standards for handling common challenges.

## Why Universal Resources

Translating Onetime Secret involves consistent challenges across languages:

- How to translate "secret" without personal/emotional connotations
- Maintaining the password vs. passphrase distinction
- Preserving brand voice while adapting to cultural norms
- Ensuring consistent quality across all translations

These universal resources document proven approaches from multiple language teams.

## Resources

### Core Concepts

- **[Translating "Secret"](./secret-concept)** - How to handle the word "secret" in different language contexts, with examples from Danish, Italian, Chinese, and more

- **[Password vs. Passphrase](./password-passphrase)** - Maintaining the critical distinction between account credentials and secret protection

### Style and Quality

- **[Voice and Tone](./voice-and-tone)** - Patterns for active vs. passive voice, formality levels, and cultural adaptations

- **[Brand Terms](./brand-terms)** - Terms that should not be translated and guidance on brand name usage

- **[Quality Checklist](./quality-checklist)** - Comprehensive checklist for pre-submission review

## Usage Pattern

1. **Before translating**: Read all universal resources
2. **During translation**: Reference these resources for consistent decisions
3. **Before submitting**: Use the quality checklist to verify your work
4. **When stuck**: Check if another language solved a similar problem

## Language-Specific Resources

After reviewing universal guidance, consult the locale-specific resources:

- **[Glossary](/en/translations/glossary)** - Standardized term translations per language
- **[Language Notes](/en/translations/language-notes)** - Language-specific rules and exceptions

These combine with universal guidance in each locale's export guide.
