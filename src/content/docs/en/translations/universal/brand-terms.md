# Brand Terms

Certain terms must remain untranslated to maintain brand identity and product consistency across all locales.

## Do Not Translate

### Company and Product Names

| Term | Usage | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Onetime Secret** | Company and product name | Always as two words, "Onetime" capitalized |
| **OTS** | Product abbreviation | Only when used as brand abbreviation |

### Product Tier Names

| Term | Context |
|------|---------|
| **Identity Plus** | Subscription tier name |
| **Global Elite** | Subscription tier name |
| **Custom Install** | Self-hosted product offering |

## About the Brand Name

In "Onetime Secret", "Onetime" functions as a compound adjective that modifies the noun "Secret". It describes the key characteristic - the secret can only be accessed once.

### Spelling Variants

Three common spellings exist in English:

| Spelling | Usage |
|----------|-------|
| "one-time" | Standard English adjective (hyphenated before nouns) |
| "one time" | Two words (informal usage) |
| "onetime" | Compound form - **canonical brand spelling** |

### When Translating Nearby Text

The hyphenated form "one-time" is standard English when used as an adjective:

- "one-time password" - translatable concept
- "one-time code" - translatable concept
- "one-time link" - translatable concept

But the compound form "Onetime" is always part of the brand name and should not be translated.

**Examples:**

| Context | Treatment |
|---------|-----------|
| "Welcome to Onetime Secret" | Keep "Onetime Secret" untranslated |
| "Create a one-time link" | Translate "one-time" and "link" as appropriate |
| "Your OTS account" | Keep "OTS" untranslated |

## Technical Terms to Preserve

These technical terms should generally remain in English (or use established loan words in your language):

| Term | Reason |
|------|--------|
| API | Universal technical standard |
| URL | Universal technical standard |
| DNS | Universal technical standard |
| SSL/TLS | Security protocols |
| HTTP/HTTPS | Web protocols |
| JSON | Data format |
| OAuth | Authentication standard |
| SSO | Single Sign-On (may have locale equivalent) |

**Note:** Some languages have established equivalents for terms like "URL" or "API". Use your language's standard technical vocabulary, but ensure consistency throughout your translation.

## Product Feature Names

These features may have translated descriptions, but the feature name itself follows specific patterns:

| Feature | Guidance |
|---------|----------|
| Dashboard | May be translated if common in your locale |
| API Keys | "API" stays English; "Keys" may be translated |
| Webhook | Technical term; keep or use locale standard |
| Metadata | May be translated if locale has standard term |

## Examples in Context

### Correct Usage

> Bienvenue sur Onetime Secret
> (Welcome to Onetime Secret - French)

> Erstellen Sie einen einmaligen Link mit Onetime Secret
> (Create a one-time link with Onetime Secret - German)

> Identity Plus 플랜으로 업그레이드하세요
> (Upgrade to Identity Plus plan - Korean)

### Incorrect Usage

> Bienvenue sur Secret Unique ❌
> (Brand name translated)

> Erstellen Sie einen Link mit Einmalgeheimnis ❌
> (Brand name translated)

> 아이덴티티 플러스 플랜으로 업그레이드하세요 ❌
> (Product tier name phonetically transliterated - should keep English)

## When in Doubt

If you're unsure whether a term should be translated:

1. Check if it's in this list of brand terms
2. Look at how similar professional software handles it in your language
3. Ask in the GitHub discussions
4. Default to keeping the English term until confirmed
