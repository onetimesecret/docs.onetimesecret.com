## Base URI

`https://REGION.onetimesecret.com/api`

Where `REGION` is either `us` or `eu`.

<!-- ::callout{icon="i-heroicons-globe-alt"} -->
**Data Locality and Region Selection**
- Choose a region (e.g. US [`us.onetimesecret.com`](https://us.onetimesecret.com/)) or EU ([`eu.onetimesecret.com`](https://eu.onetimesecret.com/)). See [Regions](/en/regions) for all options.
- Consider factors like data sovereignty, latency, and compliance requirements
- **NOTE:** Default `onetimesecret.com` remains operational and routes to an active data center, using a specific locality is recommended as this functionality may be deprecated in the future.
::

## Authentication
We support two modes of API usage:

### Authenticated Access

`https://USERNAME:APITOKEN@REGION.onetimesecret.com/api`

- Use HTTP Basic Authentication for full API capabilities
- The username is your account login
- The password is the API token from your account page

### Anonymous Access

`https://REGION.onetimesecret.com/api`

- Limited functionality available without authentication
- Ideal for quick, one-time secret sharing
- Can be used for both creating and retrieving secrets

## Data Locality
Onetime Secret supports multiple geographic data centers. We follow a zero data sharing policy between regions, ensuring complete data isolation. Choose the right data center for your needs:

- **EU Data Center:** [eu.onetimesecret.com](https://eu.onetimesecret.com/)
- **US Data Center:** [us.onetimesecret.com](https://us.onetimesecret.com/)

### Important Considerations:
- You can choose a specific data locality by navigating directly to the desired domain
- The location of your secret is always clear from the generated link (e.g., `us.onetimesecret.com/secret/abcd1234`)
- **NOTE:** Currently, access via `onetimesecret.com/api` is still operational but using a specific locality is recommended as this functionality may be deprecated in the future.

## Custom Domains
Onetime Secret supports custom domain configurations for organizations with specific networking or branding requirements via our [Identity Plus](https://onetimesecret.com/pricing) plan.

### Custom Domain Benefits
- **Private Branding:** Use your own domain (e.g., `secrets.example.com`) for API access and secret sharing
- **Consistent User Experience:** Maintain your organization's visual and trust identity with your customers and partners.
- **Include during employee training:** Use custom domains to reinforce your organization's security practices and workflows.
