##  Use Cases for Custom Domains

Secret Links with Custom Domains provide a high-degree of security for sensitive data sharing while maintaining brand consistency and continuity. Here are some ways that our customers use our service.

### 1. Onboarding or invoicing clients

When requesting sensitive information from a client, such as financial details or credit card information, ask them to share it by creating a secret link at secrets.example.com. This ensures that the information is shared securely and is only accessible to the intended recipient.

**Benefit**: By using a custom domain, you can reinforce your brand identity and build trust with your clients. The client will recognize the domain and feel more confident sharing sensitive information.

### 2. DevOps Credentials

When managing deployments across multiple environments and teams, share temporary access credentials through secure.example.com. Development teams can safely exchange database passwords, API tokens, and configuration files that automatically expire after first use, preventing these sensitive details from being exposed in code repositories, chat logs, or email threads.

**Benefit**: By integrating your custom domain with automated CI/CD pipelines, you maintain security best practices while keeping credential management seamless within your development workflow. Devs can trust that credentials come from an authorized source, and automated rotation ensures that exposed credentials cannot be reused.

### 3. Employee Onboarding

When bringing new team members aboard, streamline their first-day access by sending temporary login credentials through access.example.com. HR and IT teams can prepare individualized welcome packages containing initial passwords, VPN configurations, and sensitive documentation links that expire once accessed, ensuring that credentials don't linger in email inboxes or get accidentally forwarded.

**Benefit**: By using your branded domain for credential distribution, you create a professional onboarding experience while establishing healthy security practices. New employees can confidently access resources knowing they're coming from a trusted company source.

### 4. Private HR Communications

When handling sensitive employee information such as salary details, tax identification numbers, or benefits enrollment codes, share confidential data through hrinfo.example.com. HR teams can send time-sensitive links to individual employees containing their personal information as secure text, ensuring that sensitive details expire after access and remain protected in compliance with data privacy regulations.

**Benefit**: By utilizing your company's branded domain for confidential HR communications, you maintain professional standards while meeting compliance requirements for handling personally identifiable information. Employees can securely access their sensitive information through a trusted channel that reinforces your commitment to data protection.

### 5. Temporary Staff Access
When managing rotating clinical staff, residents, or temporary personnel, securely communicate initial login credentials through tempaccess.example.com. Administrative teams can create time-sensitive links containing system usernames and temporary passwords, where the secure message containing these credentials expires after first viewing.

Note: When implementing this solution, ensure your complete security stack maintains compliance with relevant healthcare regulations such as HIPAA or GDPR. OneTimeSecret should be used only for the secure communication of initial access credentials, while actual system access durations and permissions should be managed through your organization's access control systems. While the service provides more security than email for sharing sensitive information like PHI, it should be used as a stopgap rather than a permanent solution for such data - consider implementing dedicated HIPAA-compliant secure messaging systems for regular PHI communication.

## Summary

The ability to generate secure, time-bound links through your branded domain provides additional security without compromising efficiency. Each use case demonstrates how Custom Domains enhance both security posture and professional presence.
