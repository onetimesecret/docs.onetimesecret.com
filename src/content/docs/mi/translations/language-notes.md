# Māori (mi-NZ) Translation Notes

## Key Translation Points

### Central Term "Secret"
- Translated to **"karere huna"** (hidden message) rather than a direct translation of "secret" as "mea huna" (secret thing)
- This captures the concept better in Māori context

### Brand Voice in Māori
- Maintains a clear, professional yet approachable tone
- Uses authentic Māori expressions while keeping technical concepts clear
- Prioritizes clarity over literal translations

### Key Technical Terms
- **passphrase** → "kupu karapa" (distinct from password/kupuhipa)
- **burn** → "whakawareware" (permanently delete before viewing)
- **encrypt/encrypted** → "whakamuhumuhu/muhumuhu"
- **colonel** → "kaiwhakahaere" (administrator)

### Grammar Structure
- Uses active, imperative voice for buttons and actions
- Uses passive voice for status messages and notifications
- Addresses users in second person ("koe")
- Maintains consistent punctuation and avoids contractions

### Cultural Adaptation
- Incorporates Māori conventions for time, dates, and measurements
- Uses Māori greeting styles and sentence structures where appropriate
- Ensures translations sound natural to Māori speakers

## Translation Decisions

### 1. "Secret" → "Karere Huna" rather than "Mea Huna"

**Reasoning:**
- Better captures the nature of what's being shared through the platform (messages, information)
- Avoids connotations of personal secrets/private affairs that "mea huna" might suggest
- Creates consistency with how other platforms translate similar concepts in Māori

**Examples:**
- "Create a secret" → "Waihanga karere huna" (not "Waihanga mea huna")
- "Your secret was viewed" → "I tirohia tō karere huna"
- "Secret content" → "Ihirangi karere huna"

### 2. Verb Forms for UI Elements

**Reasoning:** Clear distinction between active/imperative voice for actions and passive/declarative voice for status messages

**Examples:**
- Action button: "Create Secret" → "Waihanga Karere Huna" (imperative)
- Status message: "Secret created" → "Kua hangaia te karere huna" (passive)
- Button: "Copy to clipboard" → "Tārua ki te papatopenga" (imperative)
- Status: "Copied to clipboard" → "Kua tāruatia ki te papatopenga" (passive)

### 3. Technical Terms

**Reasoning:** Balance authenticity with accessibility

**Examples:**
- "encryption/encrypted" → "whakamuhumuhu/muhumuhu" (relates to making something secret/whispered)
- "passphrase" → "kupu karapa" (a phrase that grants access)
- "domain" → "rohe" (territory/region)
- "dashboard" → "papatohu" (guidance board)

### 4. Cultural Adaptations

**Examples:**
- "Welcome Back" → "Nau Mai Anō" (traditional Māori welcome expression)
- "You've got (secret) mail" → "He īmēra (huna) tāu" (using Māori possession structure)
- Time expressions follow Māori conventions

### 5. Brand and Product Names

**Reasoning:** Following the style guide, brand names remain untranslated but descriptions are translated

**Examples:**
- "Identity Plus" remains "Identity Plus" (untranslated)
- "Onetime Secret" remains "Onetime Secret" (untranslated)
- "Custom Install" description → "Tāutatanga Ritenga" (customized installation)

4. **Technical Precision**

5. **Accessibility Enhancements**
   - Focused on clear, direct language accessible to all Māori speakers

   - Avoided overly academic or formal language

This translation approach makes Onetime Secret accessible and culturally appropriate for Māori-speaking users while maintaining the technical precision and security focus essential to the application.
