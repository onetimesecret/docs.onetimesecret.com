# Arabic (ar) Translation Notes

## Language Considerations

### Right-to-Left (RTL) Layout
- Arabic is written from right to left
- UI elements should be mirrored
- Numbers and Latin script remain LTR within RTL text

### Core Terminology

**Secret:** سر (sirr)
- Appropriate for professional security contexts
- Used from "سر الدولة" (state secret) to business usage

**Password vs Passphrase:**
- Password: كلمة المرور (kalimat al-muroor) - for account authentication
- Passphrase: عبارة المرور (ibarat al-muroor) - for secret protection

**Burn:** حذف نهائياً (hadhf niha'iyan)
- "Final deletion" is more natural than literal "burn" in digital context

### Formality
- Use formal second person with appropriate verb forms
- Maintain respectful, professional tone

### Technical Terms
- Use established Arabic terminology where available
- Keep DNS, URL, etc. in Latin as universally used
