I'll help you create a Korean translation for the OneTime Secret platform based on the provided translation style guide and glossary. Let me prepare a Korean translation of the JSON content.

First, let me analyze the key terminology and concepts from the translation guide:

- **secret**: Should be translated with an emphasis on confidentiality, focusing on the message/content being shared rather than personal secrets
- **password vs. passphrase**: Must maintain a clear distinction between account credentials and secret protection
- **colonel**: Should be translated as "administrator"
- **burn**: Should emphasize permanent deletion before viewing
- **Brand terms**: "Onetime Secret", "OTS", "Identity Plus", "Global Elite", "Custom Install" should not be translated

Here's the Korean translation of the provided JSON content:

I've created a Korean translation of the OneTime Secret platform JSON file based on the translation style guide and glossary provided. Here are some key translation choices I made:

### Key Terminology

1. **Secret**: Translated as "비밀 메시지" (secret message) rather than just "비밀" (secret) to emphasize the nature of confidential information being shared rather than personal secrets.

2. **Password vs. Passphrase**:
   - Password: "비밀번호" - standard term for account login credentials
   - Passphrase: "접근 문구" - translated as "access phrase" to distinguish it from account passwords

3. **Burn**: Translated as "소각" (incinerate/burn) to emphasize permanent deletion before viewing.

4. **Brand Terms**: Left untranslated as specified - "Onetime Secret", "OTS".

### Translation Style

1. **Voice and Tone**:
   - Used active, imperative voice for buttons and actions (e.g., "비밀 링크 생성" for "Create secret link")
   - Used passive or declarative voice for status messages and notifications (e.g., "복사됨" for "Copied")

2. **Grammar and Style**:
   - Maintained clear, professional language while keeping it accessible
   - Used standard punctuation appropriately
   - Addressed users directly using second person

3. **Clarity and Cultural Adaptation**:
   - Selected natural-sounding translations over literal ones
   - Ensured translations would be understood by users with varying technical backgrounds

The translation maintains the JSON structure exactly as in the original, preserving all keys, nested objects, and placeholders like `{count}` and `{duration}` for proper functionality.

I'll continue with the Korean translation of the provided JSON locale file, maintaining the same translation principles and terminology consistency as before.

I've completed the Korean translation of the additional JSON locale file for the OneTime Secret platform. This translation follows the same principles and terminology consistency established in the previous sections:

### Key Terminology Consistency

1. **Secret**:
   - Consistently translated as "비밀 메시지" (secret message) throughout the interface
   - For shorter UI elements, occasionally used "비밀" where space is limited but context is clear

2. **Passphrase**:
   - Consistently translated as "접근 문구" to maintain distinction from account passwords

3. **Burn**:
   - Maintained as "소각" (incinerate/burn) throughout to emphasize permanent deletion

4. **Brand Names**:
   - Left untranslated as specified: "Onetime Secret", "Identity Plus"

### Translation Style Elements

1. **Voice and Tone**:
   - Used active, imperative voice for action buttons and user instructions
   - Used passive or declarative voice for status messages and system information
   - Maintained a professional yet approachable tone throughout

2. **Cultural Adaptation**:
   - Adapted technical terms to be natural in Korean while maintaining technical accuracy
   - Preserved placeholders like `{0}`, `{1}` for dynamic content

3. **Grammar and Style**:
   - Used standard Korean punctuation and sentence structure
   - Addressed users directly using the second person where appropriate
   - Ensured natural-sounding translations for UI elements

The translation preserves all JSON structure and placeholders to ensure the application functions correctly while providing a natural, localized experience for Korean-speaking users.

# Thinking Behind Translation Adjustments

When reviewing and translating the Korean locale for OneTime Secret, I made several deliberate adjustments to existing text to improve consistency, clarity, and naturalness. Here's the thinking behind these adjustments:

## 1. Terminology Consistency

The most important adjustment was establishing consistent terminology for key concepts throughout the application. Some existing terms appeared to be inconsistently translated or didn't fully capture the intended meaning:

- **"secret"**: I consistently translated this as "비밀 메시지" (secret message) rather than just "비밀" (secret) to clearly distinguish it from generic secrets. This better communicates the concept of a confidential information package being shared, as emphasized in the translation guide.

- **"passphrase"**: I consistently used "접근 문구" (access phrase) to distinguish it from account passwords ("비밀번호"). This provides a clearer distinction between the protection for individual secrets versus account credentials.

- **"burn"**: I consistently used "소각" (incinerate) to emphasize the permanent deletion aspect, maintaining the metaphor while ensuring clarity in Korean.

## 2. Natural Language Flow

Some existing translations appeared to follow English sentence structure too closely, which can sound awkward in Korean. I adjusted these to follow more natural Korean language patterns while preserving the original meaning.

## 3. Technical Accuracy

I ensured that technical terms were accurately translated while remaining accessible to both technical and non-technical users. This included careful translation of concepts related to encryption, security features, and domain settings.

## 4. Cultural Adaptation

Some phrases were adjusted to better resonate with Korean users' expectations and communication norms, making the interface feel more native rather than obviously translated.

# Summary of Changes to the Korean (South) Translation

## Key Terminology Improvements

1. **Consistent Translation of "secret"**: Changed inconsistent uses of "비밀" to "비밀 메시지" throughout the application to clarify the nature of what's being shared.

2. **Clear Distinction between "password" and "passphrase"**: Implemented "비밀번호" for account passwords and "접근 문구" for secret protection consistently.

3. **Technical Term Clarity**: Terms like "burn" (소각), "encryption" (암호화), and "one-time access" (일회성 접근) were standardized throughout the application.

## User Interface Improvements

1. **Button Labels**: Optimized button text for Korean UI conventions, ensuring they're concise while maintaining clarity.

2. **Error Messages**: Made error messages more natural and helpful in Korean while preserving their informative nature.

3. **Instructional Text**: Adjusted guidance text to sound more natural in Korean while providing clear instructions.

## Structural Enhancements

1. **Korean Sentence Structure**: Reworked sentences that followed English structure to use natural Korean grammar patterns.

2. **Honorifics and Politeness Levels**: Maintained consistent politeness levels throughout the interface appropriate for a professional application.

3. **Length Considerations**: Adjusted translations to account for text expansion/contraction between English and Korean to ensure UI elements display properly.

These changes collectively create a more cohesive, natural, and professional Korean localization that will better serve Korean-speaking users of OneTime Secret while maintaining the security focus and clear communication that is central to the application.
