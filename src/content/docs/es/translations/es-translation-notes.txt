Thank you. I notice some choice adjustments to the existing es text. Can
you describe the thinking behind those and list important examples. Followed by a "Summary of Changes to the Germany Translation"

Okay, let's break down the adjustments made to the existing Spanish (`es`) translations. The goal was to ensure accuracy, consistency, natural phrasing for Spanish spoken broadly (aiming for neutrality where possible), and adherence to the provided translation guidelines.

**Thinking Behind Changes & Important Examples (Spanish - `es`):**

1.  **Consistency of Core Terms:**
    *   **Rationale:** The initial file had some inconsistencies or used terms that could be refined based on the guidelines, especially regarding `secret`, `password`, and `passphrase`.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **`secret`**: Consistently translated as `secreto` when referring to the confidential item being shared (e.g., `web.COMMON.secret`, `web.COMMON.button_create_secret`, `web.private.created_success`). This aligns with the guideline to emphasize the confidential *item*, distinguishing it from personal secrets. While `mensaje` (message) could be used, `secreto` retains the core concept of confidentiality inherent in the platform's name and function.
        *   **`password`**: Consistently translated as `contraseña` when referring to the *account login* credential (e.g., `web.COMMON.password_placeholder`, `web.login.button_sign_in`, `web.account.changePassword.currentPassword`). This is the standard term in Spanish for account passwords.
        *   **`passphrase`**: Consistently translated as `frase de contraseña` when referring to the protection for an *individual secret* (e.g., `web.COMMON.secret_passphrase`, `web.COMMON.incorrect_passphrase`, `web.secrets.enterPassphrase`). This compound term clearly distinguishes it from the account `contraseña` and follows the guideline to use a term implying a phrase-based security measure. Some existing entries were corrected for consistency (e.g., `web.private.requires_passphrase`).
        *   `web.COMMON.header_dashboard`: Changed from `Cuenta` (Account) to `Panel` (Dashboard) for better accuracy, although `Cuenta` was retained elsewhere when referring to the user account itself.
        *   `web.COMMON.header_sign_in`: Changed from `Ingresar` to `Iniciar sesión` (a very common term for logging in).
        *   `web.COMMON.burn`, `web.COMMON.burned`, `web.STATUS.burned`, `web.STATUS.destroyed`: Standardized to `Destruir` (verb) / `Destruido` (past participle/status) as per the guideline for "burn".

2.  **Appropriate Voice (Imperative vs. Declarative/Passive):**
    *   **Rationale:** Guidelines specify imperative for user actions (buttons, links) and passive/declarative for informational text (status, descriptions, help).
    *   **Examples:**
        *   `web.help.learn_more`: Translated as `Más información` (Common infinitive/noun phrase for links).
        *   `web.COMMON.button_generate_secret_short`: Translated as `Generar Contraseña` (Imperative/Infinitive action).
        *   `web.help.secret_view_faq.*.description`: Descriptions translated using declarative sentences (e.g., "Estás viendo...", "Este contenido se muestra...").
        *   `web.STATUS.*_description`: Status descriptions translated using declarative/passive voice (e.g., "El enlace secreto ha sido creado...", "El secreto fue destruido manualmente...").
        *   `web.shared.post_reveal_default`: Translated as `Tu mensaje seguro se muestra a continuación.` (Passive voice).

3.  **Clarity and Natural Phrasing:**
    *   **Rationale:** Some existing translations were literal or could be improved for natural flow in Spanish.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   `web.COMMON.copied_to_clipboard`, `web.LABELS.copy_to_clipboard`: Changed to the standard Spanish phrase `Copiado al portapapeles` / `Copiar al portapapeles`.
        *   `web.COMMON.faq_title`: Changed from `F.A.Q.` to `Preguntas Frecuentes` (Clearer, full phrase).
        *   `web.LABELS.loading`: Changed from `Loading...` to `Cargando...` (Standard).
        *   `web.login.remember_me`: Changed from "Remember me" to `Recuérdame` (Standard phrase for this function).
        *   `web.private.requires_passphrase`: Corrected from "Requiere una frase de contraseña." to "Requiere una frase de contraseña:" for consistency in context (often followed by an input field). Similar correction in `web.shared.requires_passphrase`.

4.  **Direct Address (Tú vs. Usted):**
    *   **Rationale:** Spanish requires choosing between the informal "tú" and the formal "usted". The translations aimed for consistency, generally using the formal "usted" form (e.g., "Introduce tu contraseña", "Tu mensaje seguro") which is often safer for a professional platform addressing a broad audience, unless the context strongly implied informality (which was rare). This provides a respectful and professional tone.
    *   **Examples:** Most user-facing instructions and descriptions use forms implying "usted" (e.g., `web.help.secret_view_faq.*.description` uses "Estás viendo..." which is 2nd person singular informal 'tú', but many other descriptions use 3rd person passive like "Se notificará..." which avoids direct address choice, or imperatives like "Introduce..." which can map to 'usted'). The choice was reviewed contextually. *Correction*: Reviewing the `es.json` output, it seems the informal "tú" (e.g., "Estás viendo", "Tu mensaje", "Introduce tu contraseña") was used more consistently than initially thought, likely matching a pre-existing informal tone. The goal was consistency with the chosen form.

5.  **Completeness:**
    *   **Rationale:** Many keys contained only the English source text. These were translated according to the guidelines.
    *   **Examples:** `web.help.*`, `web.FEATURES.*`, `web.UNITS.*`, `web.INSTRUCTION.*`, `web.meta.*`, `email.*`, and many others throughout the file.

## Summary of Changes to the Spanish (`es`) Translation

*   **Terminology:** Standardized key terms like `secreto`, `contraseña`, `frase de contraseña`, `Panel`, `Iniciar sesión`, `Destruir` for consistency and guideline adherence.
*   **Voice:** Consistently applied imperative voice for actions and passive/declarative voice for informational text and descriptions.
*   **Phrasing:** Improved clarity and naturalness using standard Spanish expressions (e.g., `Copiar al portapapeles`, `Preguntas Frecuentes`, `Recuérdame`).
*   **Direct Address:** Ensured consistent use of the chosen direct address form (primarily informal "tú") when addressing the user.
*   **Completeness:** Translated numerous previously untranslated English strings across the entire file.
*   **Corrections:** Addressed minor grammatical issues, inconsistencies (e.g., trailing punctuation), and suboptimal word choices from the initial file.
