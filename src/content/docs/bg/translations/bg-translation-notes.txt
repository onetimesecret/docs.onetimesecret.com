### User

Thank you. I notice some choice adjustments to the existing bulgarian text. Can you describe the thinking behind those and list important examples

### Assistant

Okay, I can certainly explain the thinking behind the adjustments made to the existing Bulgarian text in `onetimesecret/src/locales/bg.json`. The primary goal was to ensure consistency, clarity, and adherence to the translation guidelines provided in the `onetime-translator-rev2.modelfile`, even for text that was already translated.

Here's a breakdown of the rationale with examples:

1.  **Standardizing "Passphrase":**
    *   **Guideline:** Maintain consistent translation of key terms like "password/passphrase".
    *   **Observation:** The original file used multiple Bulgarian terms for "passphrase", including "фраза" (phrase), "тайна фраза" (secret phrase), and sometimes "парола" (password).
    *   **Change:** I standardized the translation to "парола" (password) in most user-facing instances. While "passphrase" implies potentially longer input, "парола" is the most common and widely understood term in Bulgarian software interfaces for this type of input field or concept. Using a single, familiar term reduces confusion. For the label specifically defining it, I used "Парола за тайната" (`web.COMMON.secret_passphrase`) for extra clarity.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   `web.COMMON.incorrect_passphrase`: "Грешна фраза" -> "Грешна парола"
        *   `web.COMMON.error_passphrase`: "...тайната фраза..." -> "...паролата..."
        *   `web.private.requires_passphrase`: "Изисква фраза." -> "Изисква парола."
        *   `web.LABELS.passphrase_protected`: "Protected with passphrase" -> "Защитено с парола"

2.  **Refining "Secret" Translation:**
    *   **Guideline:** Translate "secret" as confidential information being shared, not personal secrets. The example given was Danish "besked" (message).
    *   **Observation:** The original file mostly used "секрет" (a direct loanword often implying personal/state secrets) or "тайна" (secret). "Съобщение" (message) was used occasionally.
    *   **Change:** I primarily shifted from "секрет" to "тайна". "Тайна" feels more natural and appropriate in Bulgarian for the concept of confidential information being shared ephemerally in this context. I retained "съобщение" where it fit well (e.g., "Вашето тайно съобщение" - Your secret message). This aligns better with the guideline's intent than the direct loanword "секрет".
    *   **Examples:**
        *   `web.help.secret_view_faq.can_i_view_again.description`: "...този секрет..." -> "...тази тайна..."
        *   `web.help.secret_view_faq.how_to_copy.description`: "...целия секрет." -> "...цялата тайна."
        *   `web.private.created_success`: "Secret created successfully!" -> "Тайната е създадена успешно!"
        *   `information-no-longer-available`: "Този секрет..." -> "Тази тайна..."

3.  **Improving Clarity and Natural Phrasing:**
    *   **Guideline:** Prioritize clarity over casual language; use natural-sounding translations.
    *   **Observation:** Some phrases felt slightly awkward, overly literal, or used non-standard terms. The concept of deletion/destruction wasn't always consistently clear.
    *   **Change:** I adjusted wording for better flow and precision in Bulgarian. I replaced vague or incorrect terms like "отрязано" (truncated/cut off) or the non-standard "епременно" with clearer terms like "изтрито" (deleted) and often added "перманентно" (permanently) for emphasis, reflecting the irreversible nature of the action. Placeholder text was made more idiomatic.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   `web.COMMON.secret_placeholder`: "...отива тук..." -> "...се въвежда тук..." (More natural for input placeholder)
        *   `web.help.secret_view_faq.can_i_view_again.description`: "...пълно отрязано..." -> "...перманентно изтрито..." (Clearer meaning than "cut off")
        *   `web.shared.secret_was_truncated`: Corrected typo "tuncated" and used "отрязана" (truncated), which is correct here, unlike deletion contexts.
        *   `password-strength` levels: Adjusted English levels ("Great", "Meh") to more standard Bulgarian equivalents ("Отлична", "Задоволителна").

4.  **Ensuring Voice Consistency (Active/Passive):**
    *   **Guideline:** Use active, imperative voice for user actions (buttons) and passive/declarative for informational content (status messages).
    *   **Observation:** The original file was generally good, but reviewing and applying this consistently during the translation of remaining strings helped reinforce it.
    *   **Change:** Ensured newly translated strings and reviewed existing ones followed this pattern. For instance, button labels use verbs like "Създай" (Create), "Генерирай" (Generate), while status messages use forms like "е създадена" (is created), "беше прегледана" (was viewed).
    *   **Examples:**
        *   `web.COMMON.button_create_secret`: "Създай тайна връзка" (Imperative - Correct)
        *   `web.private.created_success`: "Тайната е създадена успешно!" (Passive/Declarative - Correct)

These adjustments aim to make the Bulgarian localization more consistent, clearer, and more natural-sounding for native speakers, while strictly adhering to the specific terminology and tone guidelines provided.



## Summary of Changes to the Bulgarian Translation

I've made consistent updates to clearly distinguish between regular passwords (used for account authentication) and passphrases (used for protecting secrets) throughout the Bulgarian translation file. Here's a summary of the changes:

### Terminology Distinction

1. **"парола" (password)** - Kept for user authentication contexts:
   - Account login credentials
   - Password fields in registration forms
   - Account-related password operations

2. **"ключова фраза" (key phrase)** - Introduced for secret protection contexts:
   - Secret creation and viewing
   - Protection mechanism for shared secrets
   - Error messages related to incorrect secret access credentials

### Key Changes by Section

1. **Common UI Elements**
   - Changed `secret_passphrase` from "Парола за тайната" to "Ключова фраза за тайната"
   - Updated `incorrect_passphrase` from "Грешна парола" to "Грешна ключова фраза"
   - Changed `enter_passphrase_here` from "Въведете паролата тук" to "Въведете ключовата фраза тук"

2. **Labels**
   - Changed `no_passphrase` from "Не се изисква парола" to "Не се изисква ключова фраза"
   - Updated `passphrase_protected` from "Защитено с парола" to "Защитено с ключова фраза"

3. **Private and Shared Sections**
   - Changed `requires_passphrase` from "Изисква парола" to "Изисква ключова фраза"
   - Updated `this_msg_is_encrypted` to reference "ключова фраза" instead of "парола"
   - Changed `passphrase-protection` from "Защита с парола" to "Защита с ключова фраза"

4. **FAQ Section**
   - Updated all references in the "trust_points" and "passphrase_points" sections
   - Changed `passphrase_title` from "Как работи опцията за парола?" to "Как работи опцията за ключова фраза?"

5. **Root Level Keys**
   - Updated `enter-a-passphrase` and `Double check that passphrase` to use "ключова фраза"

This consistent terminology distinction will help Bulgarian users better understand the different security contexts - regular account passwords versus the special protection mechanism (passphrase) used for securing shared secrets.
