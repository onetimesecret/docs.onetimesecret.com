# Translating the Word "Secret"

The word "secret" is central to Onetime Secret's brand and functionality, but translating it effectively requires understanding the nuances across languages and cultures.

## The Challenge

Direct translations of "secret" often carry connotations of:
- Personal, hidden information
- Confidential or classified data
- Something deliberately concealed
- Emotional or relationship secrets

However, in Onetime Secret's context, we're referring to:
- **Confidential information being shared**
- **Temporary, secure content**
- **Professional or functional data**
- **Messages with security protection**

## Successful Approaches from Different Languages

### Danish Example (Canonical)
**Correct**: "Beskeder" (messages)
**Incorrect**: "Hemmeligheder" (secrets)

The Danish translation team identified that "hemmeligheder" implies personal or hidden affairs that don't match the intended meaning. "Beskeder" better captures the nature of secure messages being shared.

### Italian Adaptation
**Shifted to**: "messaggio" (message) and "monouso" (single-use)
**Away from**: "segreto" (secret)

Italian translators found that "segreto" had similar personal/emotional connotations. They emphasized functional aspects instead:
- "Link monouso" instead of "Link segreti"
- "Crea messaggio" instead of "Crea segreti"

### Chinese (Simplified) Strategy
**Adopted**: "内容" (content) and "一次性链接" (one-time links)
**Context**: Moved away from "秘密" which implies personal secrets

The Chinese team emphasized the functional nature:
- "创建内容" (create content)
- "获取内容" (retrieve content)
- "一次性链接" (one-time links)

### Japanese Approach
**Maintained**: "シークレット" (katakana loan word)
**Reasoning**: Technical term that avoids personal connotations of "秘密"

Japanese kept the loan word to create a clear technical distinction from personal secrets.

### Other Language Patterns

- **German**: "Geheimnis" works well in technical contexts
- **Korean**: "비밀 메시지" (secret message) emphasizes the message aspect
- **Māori**: "karere huna" (hidden message) focuses on the message nature
- **Bulgarian**: "тайна" (confidential) rather than personal secret implications

## Guidelines for New Languages

When translating "secret" in your language:

1. **Consider context over literal translation**
   - What does "secret" imply in everyday usage?
   - Does it suggest personal/emotional content?

2. **Explore functional alternatives**
   - "message", "content", "information"
   - "one-time", "temporary", "secure"
   - "confidential", "protected", "private"

3. **Test with technical users**
   - Does the term sound professional?
   - Is it clear this is about sharing information securely?

4. **Maintain consistency**
   - Use the same term throughout the interface
   - Document your choice for other translators

## Key Questions to Ask

- Does your translation suggest the content is being **shared** rather than **hidden**?
- Would a business professional feel comfortable using this term?
- Does it distinguish from personal/emotional secrets?
- Is it clear this is about temporary, secure information?

## When in Doubt

If direct translation creates confusion, follow the Danish/Italian model:
- Emphasize the **message** or **content** aspect
- Highlight the **temporary** or **one-time** nature
- Focus on **security** rather than **secrecy**

The goal is clarity and professionalism, not literal translation fidelity.
