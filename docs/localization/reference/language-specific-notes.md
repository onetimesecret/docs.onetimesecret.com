# Language-Specific Translation Insights

Key learnings from translation work across different languages, focusing on successful approaches and common challenges.

## Major Terminology Decisions

### The "Secret" Challenge

**Languages that shifted away from literal translation:**
- **Italian**: "segreto" → "messaggio" and "monouso" (single-use)
- **Chinese**: "秘密" → "内容" (content) and "一次性链接" (one-time links)
- **Danish**: "hemmeligheder" → "beskeder" (messages)

**Insight**: Personal/emotional connotations of "secret" often don't match the functional nature of the product.

**Languages that maintained "secret" successfully:**
- **German**: "Geheimnis" works well in technical contexts
- **Japanese**: "シークレット" (katakana) creates technical distinction
- **Spanish**: "secreto" remained clear and professional

### Password vs. Passphrase Distinction

**Successful differentiation strategies:**

**Bulgarian**: Clear distinction with different word roots
- Password: "парола" (parola)
- Passphrase: "ключова фраза" (key phrase)

**Korean**: Functional approach
- Password: "비밀번호" (standard term)
- Passphrase: "접근 문구" (access phrase)

**German**: Technical loan word approach
- Password: "Passwort"
- Passphrase: "Passphrase" (keeps technical distinction)

## Voice and Formality Patterns

### Successful Formality Choices

**German**: Informal "Du" form throughout
- Creates approachable, modern feel
- Consistent with tech industry norms
- "Erstelle dein Geheimnis" rather than formal "Sie"

**Spanish**: Generally informal "tú"
- "Crea tu secreto" feels more personal and direct
- Matches expectations for web applications

**Korean**: Professional but accessible
- Used appropriate honorific levels for software context
- Balanced respect with usability

### Active/Passive Voice Implementation

**Italian**: Clean distinction
- Actions: "Inizia" (Start), "Modifica" (Edit)
- Status: "Copiato" (Copied), "Modificato" (Modified)
- Removed unnecessary exclamation marks

**Japanese**: Natural adaptation
- Imperative for buttons: "削除" (Delete)
- Passive for status: "削除済み" (Deleted)
- Maintained politeness levels appropriate for software

## Cultural Adaptations That Worked

### Māori (mi)
**"Secret" → "karere huna" (hidden message)**
- Captured functional nature rather than literal translation
- Respected Māori language structure and concepts
- Created authentic-feeling technical terminology

### Chinese (Simplified)
**Functional emphasis over literal translation**
- "创建内容" (create content) instead of "create secrets"
- "一次性链接" (one-time links) emphasizes core feature
- Avoided emotional connotations of "秘密"

### French
**Maintained professional tone while being accessible**
- Clear distinction between FR and CA variants where needed
- "Auto-hébergé" for self-hosted became standard
- Balanced technical precision with natural flow

## Common Successful Patterns

### UI Text Optimization
**Across multiple languages**: Shortened verbose interface text
- Buttons: Prefer single action words over full phrases
- Tooltips: Clear and concise over explanatory
- Error messages: Direct and helpful

### Technical Term Handling
**Mixed approach works well**:
- Keep established technical terms (API, DNS, HTTPS)
- Translate functional concepts (secret, password, hosting)
- Adapt brand-specific terms (colonel → administrator)

### Consistency Strategies
**Document decisions clearly**:
- Many languages created internal glossaries
- Established voice patterns early and maintained them
- Regular reviews caught inconsistencies

## Lessons for Future Languages

### Start with Core Concepts
1. Decide on "secret" translation approach early
2. Establish password/passphrase distinction
3. Choose formality level and voice patterns
4. Test with technical terms your audience uses

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Don't assume direct translation works
- Test implications of word choices
- Consider how terms sound in business vs. personal contexts
- Adapt metaphors and idioms appropriately

### Practical Considerations
- Account for text expansion/contraction in UI
- Test in actual interface contexts, not just isolated phrases
- Consider screen reader accessibility in your language
- Verify terms work across different platforms and browsers

### Iteration and Feedback
- Successful translations often went through multiple revisions
- User feedback revealed unclear terms that seemed good initially
- Regular consistency reviews caught drift over time

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Terminology Issues
- Mixing personal/emotional "secret" with functional "information"
- Using same term for account passwords and secret passphrases
- Inconsistent formality levels within the same feature

### Cultural Mismatches
- Terms that sound too casual for business contexts
- Direct translations that carry unintended connotations
- Technical terms that exclude non-expert users

### Usability Problems
- Action buttons that don't clearly indicate what will happen
- Status messages that don't clearly communicate system state
- Error messages that blame users rather than helping them

The most successful translations balanced technical accuracy with natural language flow, creating interfaces that feel native to speakers while maintaining the professional, security-focused brand voice.
